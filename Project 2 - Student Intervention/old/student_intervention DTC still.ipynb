    "   - **Real world application**\n",
    "      - Decision trees can for example be used in credit risk analysis where a number of data points on an applicant are used to decide whether to grant a loan or not (see e.g. http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLVMB_22.0.0/com.ibm.spss.statistics.cs/spss/tutorials/trees_credit_intro1.htm, http://dni-institute.in/blogs/decision-tree-steps-to-build-predictive-model/). Data points to be used include: loan amount, loan duration, applicant's salary, age, loan history/number of previous loans, other outstanding debt, marital status, profession or education level etc.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   - **Strengths:**\n",
    "      - Decision trees can work if the data is a mix of categorical and continuous features (only one dimension is looked at at a given step. Decision tree do not use geometric ideas like for example SVMs (where hyperplanes in features space are used to separate data)\n",
    "      - Decision trees are easy to interpret\n",
    "      - Decision trees are fast to train and to evaluate on testing data\n",
    "      - Decision trees work on binary and multi-output data\n",
    "      - There is no pre-processing (e.g. data scaling) required (since dimensions are not \"mixed\")\n",
    "   - **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "      - Decision trees easily show signs of overfitting (if not told otherwise they will become very granular on the training data, which may result in low accuracy on testing data)\n",
    "      - Decision trees are also sometimes sensitive on the type or content of input data (the algorithm is relatively brute force)\n",
    "      - In some problems (e.g. with purely continuous input data) the simple cartesian product logic (dealing with one dimension at a time) could result in too complex trees where an SVM or linear model could work much better\n",
    "   - **Why is this a good model?:**\n",
    "      - Decision trees could work well here because of the mixture of continuous and categorical input data\n",
    "      - Also decision trees could be accurate enough for the admittedly important question at hand (as long as overfitting is prevented)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "* **Support Vector Machines**\n",
    "   - **Real world application**:\n",
    "      - SVMs are used in biosciences, for example for classification/structure prediction of proteins (https://noble.gs.washington.edu/papers/noble_support.pdf) or genes through image analysis. SVMs work here because of high dimensionality of the data (images) as well as noise present in the images (SVMs are quite robust to noise). \n",
    "      - Other applications include: hand-written text classification (e.g. http://file.scirp.org/pdf/ENG_2013072909321491.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Strengths:**\n",
    "      - SVMs work well in higher dimensional settings (many features) or with complex data\n",
    "      - SVMs are flexible enough to deal with non-linearly separable or even very complex data due to the use of an error term or possible choice of different kernels\n",
    "      - On a similar note, SVMs are robust to noise, because of the error term and the idea of maximizing margins\n",
    "      \n",
    "   - **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "      - SVMs can be expensive to train (see also our example below) - especially for higher dimensional problems\n",
    "      - May require rescaled data due to the geometric nature of SVM (hyperplanes) - for example if we have a mixture of continuous and categorical input data (otherwise there might also be numerical stability issues)\n",
    "   - **Why is this a good model?:**\n",
    "      - SVM could work well in this case because we do not have a large amount of training data (also in comparison with the number of features\n",
    "      - Also, performance is not so much of an issue here because we are not dealing with a real-time application or too many testing data points\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **k-Nearest Neighbor**\n",
    "   - **Real world application**\n",
    "   An interesting application of KNN that I would is fault detection or isolation in semiconductors. Semi-conductor functionality relies on the produced material to be an extremely regular lattice of atoms. Some recent studies (http://fumblog.um.ac.ir/gallery/170/Fault%20Detection%20Using%20the%20k-Nearest%20Neighbor%20Rule%20for%20Semiconductor%20Manufacturing%20Processes.pdf) suggest using KNN to determine whether a new batch of semiconductors is faulty or not. Features used here include some aspects of the production process as well as certain measurements of the batch. By understanding the processes and results of semiconductor production better one can devise ways to make production more reliable and reduce scrap etc.\n",
    "   - Another applications lies in text mining (e.g. spam detection). Generelly I would consider it a good benchmark model when looking for a fitting algorithm for a given application.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Strengths:**\n",
    "      - KNN is very simple to interpret or explain\n",
    "      - Due to the simplicity of the idea KNN is quite flexible (multi-purpose)\n",
    "      - Training KNN is not very expensive\n",
    "      - KNN can be used for classification but also regression\n",
    "   - **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "      - Running on new/testing data can be more expensive than with other algorithms\n",
    "      - KNN has difficulties in higher dimensions due to the curse of dimensionality: a lot of training points are required to have sufficient coverage of space to find sufficiently close training points for testing data\n",
    "   - **Why is this a good model?:**\n",
    "      - I would expect KNN to do well here because the feature space is not too high dimensional or too diverse\n",
    "      - Also, we do not need to evaluate the model in real time or for too many training points (only several hundred students)\n",

    "In this situation I would recommend using the decision tree model. In my experiments with three quite different models (Decision Tree, K-Nearest-Neighbors and Support Vector machines) there was no clear winner on accuracy to be determined. All models show accuracy scores of around 80%. However, the decision tree model is clearly the fastest out of the three considering both training and prediction time. In terms of accuracy the model performs in line with the other models (note that we had already restricted the `'max_depth`' to prevent overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice of model is supported by the fact that it is used in similar situations like loan approval/credit risk analysis. Note that because of the comparable simplicity of the model changing data or retraining the algorithm (e.g. year by year) is easy.\n",

    "Generally, when looking for the optimal algorithm to use one has to balance accuracy and performance/speed. In cases where accuracy is paramount but prediction time is less important, one would choose more complex, computationally intensive algorithms and tailor them in detail (e.g. by using extensive grid search or the like). However, when different algorithms do not show much deviation in terms of accuracy, then choosing the fastest one is certainly sensible."

    "since we are looking for good quality but only have a maximum budget of 100 \\$) and the second question whether they fit or not. So in a shop we could potentially find a pair of pants at 70 \\$, then try them on, and if they fit buy them straight away.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more precise terms the decision tree model works as follows. We are given a training data (a group of previous students) and a list of features, or information points on them. The algorithm now looks at one information point, say father's education. No it divides the groups up such that one group (e.g. father's education class < 4) is clearly more likely to fail than the other (e.g. father's education > level 3). In the next step it looks, for example, at the group of students with father's education < 3 and finds another criterion to help separate the better students from the worse, say access to internet. It may turn out that students with access to internet are more successful since they use the internet as an information source.\n",

So, all in all the parameter optimization with grid search did not yield a significant improvement in accuracy.\n",
